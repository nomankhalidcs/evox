          and are not a resident of a restricted jurisdiction, including the
          U.S. and Canada. Evox’s services are intended for users familiar

        <h1>User Accounts</h1>
        <p>
          To access specific features of the Evox platform, including
          purchasing tokenized property shares (NFTs) or participating in
          crowdfunding, you are required to create an account. Account
          creation involves providing personal details such as your name and
          email, linking a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask), and agreeing to
          Evox’s terms. Evox operates under a decentralized model,
          minimizing KYC procedures, but we may still require verification
          depending on regulatory requirements.

        <p>
          Evox enables fractional ownership of real estate properties
          through tokenization, where users can invest in property shares
          (NFTs). By participating in any tokenized real estate transaction,

            <li>
              Transactions and records on the blockchain are immutable and

            <li>
              There are inherent risks, including market fluctuations,
              regulatory changes, and liquidity constraints, that could
              impact the value of your investments.
